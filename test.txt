    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/disrupting-the-gaming-industry-with-the-same-old-playbook/">
    &lt;p&gt;With a market size of $8 billion in 2013 Massive Multiplayer Online Gaming (MMOG) is becoming big business.  It’s not just about the players, either: people are going online just to watch the games being played, a global viewership estimated at about 71.5 million as of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the brave new world of e-Sports. Some MMOG professional teams players can command six figure salaries, thanks to the finance provided by corporate sponsorships and advertising. Recently the USA recognized professional e-gamers as pro athletes eligible for P-1A visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMOG that epitomizes the birth of this new industry is perhaps &lt;a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki"&gt;League of Legends&lt;/a&gt; (LoL). LoL’s core gaming business is built around by the Free to Play model in which community building and social engagement are the main objectives. The model is in part monetized through micro-transactions in which virtual goods used in the game are purchased with real currency. The game has been popular since its release in the 2009 and has an active unique monthly user base of 67 million, generating $625 million in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real revenue driver is viewership. Online broadcasting channels are filling up the distribution space just as television did in conventional sports. Twitch.tv — one of the leading on-line game streaming channels — has partnered with game publishers and game console makers to add features that allow gamers to stream their game play live or recorded over the channel. Revenue flows primarily from the online ads targeting the soaring viewership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a viewership! LoL’s 2013 World Championship garnered online viewership of 32 million on Twitch.tv alone, significantly more than Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals, which had a peak viewership of about 26 million over various media formats.  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp8FUlAtfko"&gt;The event itself in the Los Angeles Staples Centre was a sell-out&lt;/a&gt;. Sponsors included big names like Coca Cola, Intel, and Amex, all looking to reconnect to the lucrative demographics (18-35) LoL caters to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all sounds splendidly disruptive: new technology-enabled social media redefining what we think of as sport. Yet the hype tends to obscure just how familiar the story actually is and just how much of the success is the result of canny business folk applying a well-used playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What LoL is doing in MMOGs is pretty much repeating what shoe manufacturer &lt;a href="http://www.vans.com/skate.html"&gt;Vans&lt;/a&gt; did for skateboarding. A fad for 20 years up to the 1990s, skateboarding was haphazard and disorganized: it lacked adult supervision, provided few external rewards and was widely seen as solitary activity for misfits. No sponsors or advertisers invested in it. At certain moments, only the enthusiasm of skateboarders kept the sport alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Vans made its move.  The company institutionalized the sport creating a world championship as a way to recognize player excellence and found a mass audience by selling rights to ESPN and similar channels. It invested in organized and parent-friendly skateboard parks; produced a Sundance festival winner documentary on the history of skateboard (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C78BQFDq6hM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogtown and Z-boys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;); and sponsored the Warped Tour, a series of concerts in various cities showcasing trendy, cool music in line with the skateboarding lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, just as LoL is doing today, Vans created a sports ecosystem. Its festivals, skateboard parks, and world championships represented new business lines, most of them profitable in the first half of 2000s. But the real benefit for Vans was that its strategy made the sport mainstream and opened it up to the masses, which ultimately had huge benefits for its core shoes and clothing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories like LoL and Vans illustrate a profound truth about strategy and business. Industries are reinvented and new ones are born all the time. But this does not mean that the strategies by which they are redefined or created also change. If anything, the stories of LoL and Vans illustrates just how enduring strategy actually is.  Disruption doesn’t change the rules for good strategic moves — rather, it gives new players more opportunities to apply them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/share-your-financials-to-engage-employees/">
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re searching for ways to improve employee engagement, you’ll find lots of laundry lists. Fourteen tips. Seven steps. The “&lt;a href="http://iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/the-workplace/what-engages-employees-the-most-or-the-ten-cs-of-employee-engagement#.U4yrxvldUsc"&gt;Ten C’s&lt;/a&gt;.” Most of these sources contain good-but-basic advice, like providing mentoring, encouraging two-way communication, and recognizing people when they do great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the statistics suggest that following such advice, like staying on a diet, is harder than it looks—some &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx"&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. workers say they don’t feel engaged on the job, a number that hasn’t changed much in recent years. If time-starved owners or managers don’t naturally abide by all those nostrums, are they likely to start now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a different way of thinking about engagement, because we have a different idea of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach begins with a question: Who do you think is more engaged in the business, the farmer or the hired hand? The building contractor or the guy pounding nails? The store owner or the clerk behind the counter? The answers are obvious, but they raise an equally obvious objection. Not everyone can be an owner. And as a National Bureau of Economic Research &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/may04/w10177.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows, even employees who hold an ownership stake in their employer aren’t necessarily more engaged or motivated than their nonshareholding peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the objection misses the essence of ownership. It isn’t just that owners are in charge. It’s that they’re &lt;em&gt;players&lt;/em&gt;. They’re in the game. They know the rules. They act, and they watch the numbers to find out whether their actions were on track or misguided. If they win the game, they know there’ll be a payoff. Most people think of engagement in individual terms—feeling fulfilled by the task at hand, wanting to do a good job. We see engagement as being part of a team that’s competing to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s surprisingly easy to generate this kind of engagement among employees when you make the economics of the business come alive by sharing some key financial numbers. It’s an open-book approach: people begin to watch these indicators. Then they figure out how to move them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago, for instance, a global travel-management company picked three representative U.S. branches to pilot open-book methods of building engagement and improving performance. The company’s team identified a critical financial number—site revenue minus direct site costs, known as direct profitability. Branch employees then began meeting every week to review these financial results, brainstorm ideas for improvement, and forecast future results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the company’s front-line travel counselors had behaved pretty much like employees everywhere. They did a competent job, but they didn’t worry about the financial implications of a changed itinerary or a new hotel pricing policy. Now—engaged in the business of improving their branch’s numbers—they began spotting opportunities an owner might think of. A customer-relations rep in St. Louis, for instance, contacted vendors to recover money lost due to hotel no-shows and canceled flights. Over the first few months she collected $189,093—a significant savings for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each pilot branch generated several such ideas, which they then shared with the other two. At the end of the pilot period, the experimental branches had exceeded their profit budgets by 10%, 17%, and 20%, resulting in more than $1.7 million in incremental earnings. None of the other U.S. branches hit budget that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve witnessed similar results at many other companies that follow the open-book path to engagement. A designer at a D.C.–area design/build firm says she notices “everyone caring more and being more accountable and taking responsibility.” The CEO of a midsized manufacturing company told us, “I don’t have employees in my plant anymore. I have entrepreneurs who are looking to find ways to make more money.” At one company, employees even organized small betting pools around the accuracy of each month’s profit forecast. (Now &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; engagement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most open-book companies tie incentive compensation to improvement in the key financial numbers, so employees see a payoff as well. But the real engagement comes from thinking and acting like owners.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Work-Life Balance Through Interval Training</title>

    <summary>Rest is as important as work.</summary>

    <category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Managing yourself"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Stress"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Work life balance"/>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/work-life-balance-through-interval-training/">
    &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="http://thirdpath.org/"&gt;ThirdPath Institute &lt;/a&gt;conference a few weeks ago, a great discussion arose around the fact that workloads tend to ebb and flow, and it’s important to know how to alternate between periods of peak effort and recovery. Before long, someone noted the analogy to high performance in sports, and used a phrase that piqued my curiosity: &lt;em&gt;Corporate Athlete&lt;/em&gt;. I loved the term so much I jotted it down, thinking I might make something of it in my writing and consulting. Then I Googled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops. Apparently, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz have already made quite a lot of the term corporate athlete, having coined it way back in a &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete/ar/1"&gt;2001 HBR article&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I was only 13 years late to the party!&lt;/em&gt;) and explored it in a series of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=jim+loehr+and+tony+schwartz&amp;amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;amp;index=stripbooks&amp;amp;hvadid=18834207149&amp;amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;amp;hvexid=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=14499608003987812247&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=b&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;ref=pd_sl_68t1kq542m_b"&gt;best-selling books &lt;/a&gt;about engagement, energy, and business success. So much for my plan to unleash it on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was all the more glad to find so much work already done on corporate athleticism, because it has a lot to offer my field: the challenges faced by working parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loehr and Schwartz look at how the winners in the world of sports prepare for competition and then apply these techniques to managerial work. They urge executives “to train in the same systematic, multilevel way that world-class athletes do.” No, CEOs are not forced to run wind sprints (although some do). Rather, they are coached in a holistic program designed to help them attain – and sustain– the highest performance at their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most in the writing Loehr and Schwartz have done is their frequent use of the word “balance.” In particular, they see great athletes and corporate athletes achieving the right balance across three critical dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mind and Body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Performance and Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Exertion and Recovery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people trying to succeed both at work and at home are constantly thinking in terms of balance. But perhaps Loehr and Schwartz have given us a more nuanced way of thinking about what needs to be balanced. Using their dimensions, how might someone go about becoming a superstar &lt;em&gt;Work-Life Athlete&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s think about that &lt;strong&gt;mind–body balance&lt;/strong&gt;. For athletes, the classic mistake to avoid is focusing only on preparing one’s body for the game. Great coaches equip their players to win the mental game as well the physical one. Executives, by contrast, are too likely to grind away at intellectual tasks and overlook that their bodies must be healthy if they are to have the energy to perform well on the job. As Loehr and Schwartz put it, a successful approach to sustained high performance “must pull together [many] elements and consider the person as a whole.” It must address the body, the emotions, the mind, and the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work-life athletes, mind-body balance suggests that we should get enough sleep, eat reasonably well, engage in &lt;a href="http://fathersworkandfamily.com/2013/07/25/regular-exercise-can-help-us-be-better-dads/"&gt;some exercise&lt;/a&gt; – and make room in our lives for &lt;a href="http://fathersworkandfamily.com/2012/09/19/networking-for-fatherhood-or-in-praise-of-beer-fire/"&gt;social interaction&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://fathersworkandfamily.com/2013/04/19/taking-a-break-from-parenting-benefits-everyone-or-in-praise-of-me-time-for-dads/"&gt;me time&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; and perspective-seeking through reflection and meditation or prayer. You don&amp;#8217;t have to be in perfect shape to be good at your job or effective as a parent. But if we neglect our bodies, or spirits, we may not have enough sustained energy for effectiveness in either work or family, let alone both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;performance–development balance&lt;/strong&gt; also has a particular relevance to the work-life realm. Athletes know that the vast majority of their effort is spent on development, preparing for the performance they must put in during actual competition. In business, it feels like the proportions are inverted: every day executives must perform, and only a tiny fraction of their time is set aside for “professional development.” But actually, the athlete’s understanding of the balance would make more sense for business people, too. Athletes in their development days focus on individual elements of their game and build their capacity in the fundamentals; on competition days, they pull all the pieces together and push performance to the maximum. Likewise in business, there are those high-stakes occasions when managers can only pull off what they are trying to accomplish by drawing on every competence they have; but between “big game” days, many assignments could be focused on honing particular fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider that working parents also have moments when their capabilities as work-life athletes are seriously put to the test and their performance has the greatest consequences. In those moments, they too need to pull together all their resources and abilities to make the right moves. And ideally, they would have prepared for those moments by deliberately developing individual elements in situations where the stakes were not so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to sustain a performance edge needs to figure out how to keep developing new capabilities, and not just keep drawing on existing ones. If this can’t be accomplished through daily tasks, then it requires regularly scheduled time to be set aside. Whether it’s protecting 30 minutes every other day to read up on industry developments, listening to a language-instruction course during the morning commute, or trying a new recipe every week, turning off the performance pressure creates more openness to new approaches and heightens performance in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us, finally, to the &lt;strong&gt;exertion–recovery balance&lt;/strong&gt; that Loehr and Schwartz see great athletes managing so well. “In the living laboratory of sports,” they write, “we learn that the real enemy of high performance is not stress, which, paradoxical as it may seem, is actually the stimulus for growth. Rather, the problem is the absence of disciplined, intermittent recovery.” For example, in weight lifting, one stresses muscles to the point where their fibers literally start to break down. However, after an adequate recovery period, the muscle not only heals, it grows stronger. Without rest, one ends up with be acute and chronic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business, demanding projects, with tight deadlines and stretch goals, can be great – but can’t be unremitting. Occasional overwork is a necessity, at work and in the rest of our lives, but &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/10/dont-treat-your-career-marathon-like-a-sprint/"&gt;chronic overwork &lt;/a&gt;robs us of our resilience. This reduces our performance over time, and causes damage in our work and personal lives. Similarly, too many working parents go full-tilt, non-stop to tackle all they have to do without allowing themselves the recovery time needed for sustainable effectiveness. “Recovery” for the work-life athlete might not come when they jump from the demands of one front to the demands of another. It might require taking breaks from the jumping itself. A good start might be to arrange for some standing &amp;#8220;no/limited contact&amp;#8221; time slots with managers and coworkers (e.g., specifying that no one should expect a response to an email between 6:30 and 9:30 pm). For that matter, why not set &amp;#8220;no screen&amp;#8221; hours at home, when everyone stays off their phones, tablets, and other devices and is available to each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a management standpoint, we need to rethink the notion that non-performance time is wasted time. Instead, we need to see that recovery is a key component of sustained high performance. This means we must resist continually increasing the time demands we put on our employees and expecting our employees to be constantly &amp;#8220;on call&amp;#8221; even after hours. We need to encourage our employees to take lunch breaks, relax on weekends, and actually take their vacation days, unplugged (and also do these things ourselves). By helping to strike the right balances, we can build the work-life athleticism we need when the stakes are highest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/start-with-a-theory-not-a-strategy/">
    &lt;p&gt;Well-crafted strategies are road maps to places that yield competitive advantage and generate value for the firm. But once you&amp;#8217;ve arrived, they don’t take you anyplace else. That’s a problem for companies under continual pressure from investors to find &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; sources of competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had lunch with the CEO of a large privately held corporation that illustrated this dilemma. After two decades of strong growth, he recognized that that his strategy had run its course. In the minds of his investors, his success was baked into his company’s current value and they wanted to know where he was going to find more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presented to me three broad options for growth: diversify into a rather distant, weakly-related industry; develop and sell new services desired by their somewhat narrow set of existing customers; or expand globally into the same services they provide domestically. He asked which I thought made the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I did not give him a straight answer. Instead, I suggested that what he needed was &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/what-is-the-theory-of-your-firm/ar/1"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; about strategy:&lt;/a&gt; a mental model about how his company could create value that would help him assess his three options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, a good theory reveals compelling hypotheses that subsequent experiments will validate. A good corporate theory similarly reveals likely hypotheses about how the firm can create most value. It has three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foresight&lt;/strong&gt; into the future evolution of their industry,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight &lt;/strong&gt;into what is distinctive and uniquely valuable in the composition of assets and capabilities the company possesses; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-sight&lt;/strong&gt; into how combinations of internal and external assets and opportunities can create value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company that has a good corporate theory, selecting the right next strategy should not be a problem; the fact that this CEO and I were having such a conversation about such divergent options revealed the absence of a good theory about what strategies were right for his firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to pretend that it’s easy to come up with a good corporate theory. And, if anything, companies that have comfortable market positions will find the exercise more challenging than most. Microsoft is a case in point. Although it attained a remarkable position almost decades ago, the company has struggled to find new sources of value creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, firms compete not on their strategies, but on the basis of their corporate theories. For the past several years I have asked students ranging from executives to undergraduates the simple question: If you were given $10,000 to invest in Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon, where would you invest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the pattern of responses varies, most students quickly recognize that their answers have less to do with assessments of current market positions, and more to do with assessments of each firm’s corporate theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each firm is entrenched in a market position quite distant from the others. Apple makes consumer electronics unrivaled in their ease of use. Google offers a search engine unparalleled in its speed and breadth. Facebook supports a social network unmatched in its reach. Amazon features a web store without equal in scope. But each is guided by a very different corporate theory, distinctly crafted as a reflection of the beliefs and current assets of their firm, which informs how they will move beyond their established and fully valued positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These theories (ideally) provide a sense of coherence to the growth initiatives that have pushed these firms into quite disparate and increasingly overlapping market space. Indeed, their theories seem to suggest no limit to the potential for strategic collision. Future results of strategic actions will ultimately determine the worth and accuracy of each firm’s theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, unlike a strategy, a well-crafted corporate theory can take you beyond the one position or advantage. This is not to say that your theory will necessarily be the best one, but at least it will not be dead on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

    <category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Health"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Organizational culture"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Transparency"/>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/online-reviews-could-help-fix-medicine/">
    &lt;p&gt;A basic principle of health care is that everyone strongly favors transparency – for everyone but themselves. “Sunshine is the strongest disinfectant” is the oft-used expression that supports putting information out in the open for all to see. That said, every stakeholder in health care gets a bit nervous about exposing their own data. They are quick to cite the potential downsides – that patients will not be able to understand the limitations of the information, that risk adjustment will be inadequate to explain why their performance looks below average, that they may actually &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; below average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one gets as nervous about public reporting as my health care provider colleagues. We worry that everyone else may game the system, cherry-pick patients, or that we might lose patients if the data look less than perfect. It’s safe to say that number of physicians who &lt;em&gt;hate &lt;/em&gt;the idea of public reporting is greater than the number who support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which makes it that much more fascinating that some provider organizations have recently begun putting all their patient experience data – including every patient comment about every doctor – on their Find-A-Doctor web sites. “Every” actually does mean every – the good, bad, and ugly (after removal of those that might violate patient confidentiality). And they are tied directly to the physician who delivered their care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would they do this? The initial response from some commentators was that they were trying to “out-Yelp Yelp” – that is, control the information that was appearing about them on the Web. In truth, the initial idea was less about controlling information than providing &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;of it. Rather than living with on-line comments generated by a small subset of patients motivated by who-knows-what to write in, organizations like the University of Utah decided that they would survey &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;patients electronically, and &lt;a href="http://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/"&gt;post &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; their comments&lt;/a&gt;. And they would take the chance that more data would provide a better sense of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Utah health care system was the first in the country to go down this road, and they were rewarded for their creativity and courage with a very pleasant surprise. The result over the last few years has been astounding improvement in their patients’ experience with their physicians. In 2009, only 4% of their physicians were in the top 10 percentile of Press Ganey’s national database for overall patient ratings. By 2013, it was nearly half – 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Utah leaders realized that putting their patient information on the Web wasn’t mere marketing – it was creating a powerful motivation for physicians to give every patient the best, most empathic care. Financial incentives to improve patient experience could never have produced this kind of change. What mattered was physicians’ awareness that every patient visit is a high stakes encounter – the biggest event of the patient’s day or even month. As one orthopedist put it, “It forces me to be on top of my game for every single patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is, of course, a good thing. And it’s the reason why other providers are going down this road. Piedmont Health in Georgia went live last month, and Wake Health in North Carolina went live last week. Other organizations, some very prominent, are actively planning to follow suit – including some outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their immense credit, the quality leaders at the University of Utah are helping other providers follow their lead. Some of my more suspicious colleagues have asked, “Why are they doing that? Why don’t they try to preserve the advantage that they have built?” The answer seems to be that they believe their mission requires them to do the right thing. Plus, like all academics, they relish the pride that goes with sharing a patient-centric best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah game plan is simple, graduated, but not glacial in pace. Over four years, they first expanded the amount of data that were being collected. They moved to e-surveying and started&lt;a href="http://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/pressganey.php#patient%20survey"&gt; sending surveys&lt;/a&gt; to every patient after every hospitalization or visit. Armed with more (and more timely) data, they moved to internal transparency, allowing anyone within the Utah system to see anyone else’s data. After physicians got used to the idea of others seeing their data, and realized the vast majority of comments were actually warm and even effusive, Utah went public in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact on performance at each step was dramatic, and the secret is now out. Other organizations are aware of what Utah, Piedmont, and Wake Forest are doing, and saying, “We have to do that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they do, they will be disseminating priceless marketing information about their care – most patient comments are incredibly warm, grateful, granular, and believable. But, more important, they will be helping their physicians live up to their own aspirations about the kinds of doctors they want to be. And patient care will be better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To join the conversation, register for my June 5 webinar with Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://online.krm.com/iebms/reg/reg_p1_form.aspx?ct=0011408&amp;amp;EventID=21541&amp;amp;oc=10&amp;amp;m=WEB"&gt;Engaging Doctors in the Health Care Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite a housing-foreclosure crisis and the Great Recession, homelessness in America has &lt;strong&gt;declined 17%&lt;/strong&gt; since 2005 because of a radical change in how states address the problem, according to the &lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt;. Officials have reversed the old logic of focusing on homeless people’s social problems first and housing needs second; once people are housed, some of their other problems turn out to be easier to resolve. The “housing-first” approach works only if there’s adequate affordable housing, however, so cities like Boston, where the rental market is tight, have seen increases in homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/moocs-wont-replace-business-schools-theyll-diversify-them/">
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, business school administrators — like other university officials — have been losing sleep over Massive Open Online Courses (or MOOCs), worrying that these low-cost digital alternatives will cannibalize their business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As elite business schools have started to offer their own courses through platforms like Coursera, commentators have pointed out that it’s now possible to &lt;a href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2013/12/23/online-education-mba-moocs/"&gt;cobble together an elite MBA for free&lt;/a&gt;. Others have argued that executive education programs &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/331861d6-cca2-11e3-ab99-00144feabdc0.html#axzz31idwVogc"&gt;are likely to be disrupted&lt;/a&gt;, as companies weigh the savings they could achieve by directing executives to MOOCs instead. These programs are a crucial source of revenue for business schools. At Wharton, nearly 20% of the annual revenue comes from executive education, while at Harvard Business School 26% does, and at IESE, it is nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these fears well founded? The answer depends on the students participating in MOOCs. If they fit the profile of traditional MBA or executive education enrollees, then the threat to business schools is clear. Our data suggest that this is not the case. At least at present, MOOCs run by elite business schools do not appear to threaten existing programs, but seem to attract students for whom traditional business school offerings are out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a few studies from &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2381263"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rpajournal.com/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SF2.pdf"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7476/full/503342a.html"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; have examined MOOC participants, none to date have focused specifically on those taking business classes. We analyzed data on over 875,000 students enrolled in nine MOOCs offered by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. This includes a demographic survey with over 65,000 responses. The nine courses consisted of four that introduce the MBA core — Accounting, Finance, Marketing, and Operations Management — as well as Gamification and the Global Business of Sports. These business MOOCs do not appear to be cannibalizing existing programs but do seem to be reaching at least three new and highly sought-after student populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39213" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal1.png?w=640" alt="moocfinal1"   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Wharton data, 78% of individuals who registered for an online business course came from outside of the United States. For comparison, Executive MBA programs in 2012 only attracted an average of 14% foreign students. Part-time or flexible MBA programs attracted 10%-32% foreign students, depending on the type of program. Even full-time two-year MBA programs, which attracted 45% foreign students, fall far short of the international reach of these business MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that none of the traditional business education programs can match the global reach of MOOCs, which is all the more impressive when you consider that they are operating at significantly larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For business schools, then, MOOCs are a tremendous opportunity to expand into underserved markets. Nearly half of the international students enrolled in Wharton’s MOOCs hail from developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal2.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39214" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal2.png?w=640" alt="moocfinal2"   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businessmen and women in developing countries have few sources for high quality management training; there are only five business schools in all of sub-Saharan Africa that have received AACSB, AMBA, or EQUIS accreditation –  all in South Africa. They are turning to MOOCs for accessible world-class training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even among U.S. enrollees, there appear to be important differences between the population of MOOC students and traditional business school students. First, well-educated foreign-born U.S. residents appear to be overrepresented in business MOOCs. Overall, 35% of all U.S. individuals enrolled in the Wharton business MOOCs are foreign-born, with 54% having a graduate or professional degree. Only 12.9% of the U.S. population is foreign-born. Though MOOC enrollees are quite educated overall, the rate of advanced degrees for foreign-born U.S. enrollees exceeds that of other students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17%, or one in six, of the highly educated, foreign-born American enrollees in business MOOCs are unemployed, higher than the 13% unemployment rate for native-born American MOOC enrollees. Again, we seem to be seeing groups of individuals who cannot access elite executive education courses obtaining training through MOOCs. And for the unemployed, this may be a way to obtain credentials and skills to enhance job searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final group enrolling in business MOOCs is underrepresented minorities. In open, online Wharton business courses, 19% of American students are underrepresented minorities, compared to 11% of students enrolled in traditional MBA programs at &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/interactive/diverse070420120704"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; of the top U.S. business schools. And in terms of absolute numbers, not just percentages, there are vastly more underrepresented minorities online. Across those nine top business schools, that 11% represents just 315 underrepresented minority MBA students, while 19% of the Wharton online business classes constitute 166,552 underrepresented minority students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal3.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39215" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/moocfinal3.png?w=640" alt="moocfinal3"   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business schools are trying to attract these three groups — students from outside the United States, especially developing countries, foreign-born Americans, and under-represented American minorities. According to the 2012 Application Trends Survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council, these populations were among the most likely to receive special, targeted outreach by business schools. Open, online business courses are reaching them in droves. These MOOC courses might then provide a highly enriched recruiting pool for full-time and executive MBA courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where business MOOCs are falling short is in attracting female students. While more than 40% of applicants to MBA programs are now women, only 32% of students enrolled in business MOOCs are women. That number drops to 23% in BRICS countries. Women in the developing world face even greater barriers to traditional business training than their male counterparts. Careful marketing aimed at these women might open the door for yet another large population of new business school students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If business schools want to take advantage of the MOOC opportunity to reach a more diverse group of students, they should seek to better understand those students’ motivations. For instance, lots of previous debate over MOOCs has focused on the relatively low rate of course completion. Indeed, only one out of every twelve students who enrolled in Wharton’s courses were still watching the lectures after eight weeks. Only 5% completed all of the course material and assessments (slightly higher than the 3% rate for non-business courses). And it turns out these “completers” tend to be disproportionately male, well educated, employed, and from OECD countries. Among American students, they tend to be white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its face, this finding might seem to undermine MOOCs’ potential to enhance the diversity of business school offerings. But for many students, completing an online course is not the most important outcome. Just 43% of respondents to a pre-course survey administered to nine business and non-business courses at Penn indicated that receiving a certificate of accomplishment was “extremely important” or “very important” to them. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.edx.org/"&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt; has found that only 27% rank earning a certificate of mastery as extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business schools must bear this in mind and move away from a business model of charging for certificates of completion. Instead, they must tailor offerings to the goals of these learners, whatever they may be. This could be as simple as moving to a monthly subscription or “freemium” model for access, or it could mean a more fundamental rethinking of what comprises a “course” online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear from our research that, rather than cannibalizing business school course offerings and executive education, open, online business courses appear for now to be expanding the overall reach of business education. Even in their infancy, business MOOCs from Wharton are reaching groups of students most commonly targeted for outreach by business schools: working professionals outside the United States as well as foreign-born and underrepresented minorities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOOCs are undoubtedly disrupting higher education. Business schools, like other university institutions, will need to strategically adapt to changing circumstances. But the MOOC disruption may not necessarily be the threat everyone is worried about. In fact, it looks more like an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Competition"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Disruptive innovation"/>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/whats-holding-uber-back/">
    &lt;p&gt;As a consumer, I absolutely love Uber. The other week I was at a dinner in a relatively remote part of Singapore. Afterwards, the hotel concierge furiously worked three phones to get taxi cabs to appear for the 15 people who were waiting with growing impatience. I clicked three buttons, and my ride was there in 12 minutes. It’s simple, and it works beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love Uber as a student (and teacher) of disruptive innovation theory, because the challenges the transportation company is encountering as it seeks to expand into new cities helpfully illustrate how to assess an idea’s disruptive potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important, because companies that adhere as closely as possible to the patterns of disruption have the greatest chance to create explosive growth and transform markets. Those that deviate from the approach can succeed, but they are likely to have to fight much harder and spend much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our field work applying Clayton Christensen’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/03/disruptive-innovation-explaine/"&gt;foundational research&lt;/a&gt; on disruptive innovation, we look at potential disruptors&amp;#8217; performance in three critical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the would-be disruptor should follow an approach that makes it easier and more affordable for people to do what historically has mattered to them. Making the complicated simple and the expensive affordable is why disruptors have the potential to dramatically expand a constrained market or prosper at price points that are far lower than market leaders’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber nails this. Getting a taxi is a maddeningly complex task in cities around the world. Uber’s slick user interface solves the problem in a simple, elegant way. It has had to deal with occasional customer complaints about so-called surge pricing (when the price of a ride shoots up dramatically at times of high demand, such as during major weather events or on New Year’s Eve). But it probably has a more committed user base than any business launched in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the innovator has to develop a behind-the-scenes advantage:  a way of producing a product or service that seems magical from the customer&amp;#8217;s perspective and that is difficult for other companies to replicate. Ideally, the innovator has a proprietary technology that makes the offering simple and affordable, or it has developed an innovative operating model that enables the business to keep its costs radically lower than competitors’ as it scales up. Either (or ideally both) of these advantages helps the innovator defend itself when existing competitors or others inevitably respond by trying to emulate its success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber looks solid here, as well. Its powerful back-end system allows it to manage a real-time network of cars in an extremely simple and potentially low-cost way. It can take advantage of network effects in its operations, since the more drivers it recruits, the more valuable its service become and the more other drivers want to join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final area &amp;#8212; and the one where Uber faces clear challenges &amp;#8212; is whether the would-be disruptor is following a business model that takes advantage of &amp;#8220;asymmetries of motivation&amp;#8221;. In simple terms, that means a disruptor is attacking markets that existing companies are motivated to exit or ignore because they are unprofitable or seemingly too small to matter.  (We discussed these in detail in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Whats-Next-Theories-Innovation/dp/1591391857"&gt;Seeing What’s Next&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the early days of Salesforce.com. The company sold its cloud-based customer relationship management software to small companies that could never afford more-sophisticated applications sold by industry leaders like Siebel. Salesforce.com didn’t compete against these applications. It competed against pen and paper and handmade spreadsheets. In its early days, market leaders felt no pain because Saleslforce.com wasn’t taking away any of their customers; rather, it was creating new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way disruptors take advantage of asymmetries of motivation is to build a business model that makes it financially unwise for incumbents to respond. This is at least one reason why Netflix ended up crushing Blockbuster. Netflix’s business model did not require it to charge the late fees that made up the vast majority of Blockbuster’s profits. Naturally companies are unlikely to follow strategies that appear to destroy profitable revenue streams or promise to lose them money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber is following neither of these paths. It targets exactly the same customers that taxi companies want. And customers pay fares that are generally comparable, if not higher, than ordinary taxi fares. Taxi companies therefore are naturally neither motivated to ignore nor to flee from Uber. Rather, they are fighting fiercely with every tool at their disposal, including &lt;a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/22/taxi-drivers-protest-uber-boston-offices/0YlRN0hHAHVhcxFIQ2X5aI/story.html"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; by taxi drivers and &lt;a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/05/28/rideshare-legislation-could-before-the-city-council-today-a-primer"&gt;legislative action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, the battle between traditional taxis and Uber has attracted opportunity-sniffing entrepreneurs who want to help the incumbents fight back. For example, one of the most popular apps now in Singapore is called &lt;a href="http://www.techinasia.com/grabtaxi-eat-comforts-lunch/"&gt;GrabTaxi&lt;/a&gt;, which uses an Uber-like mobile interface to simplify the process of ordering a traditional cab. That allows cab drivers to offer many of the conveniences of Uber without being disintermediated. GrabTaxi isn’t trying to disrupt the market; it’s trying to help established companies fight back against entrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these battles are great for consumers, who get to enjoy simpler, increasingly more convenient solutions. There’s little doubt that Uber will continue to penetrate the markets it targets &amp;#8212; particularly with its growing war chest of venture capital funding. But because it appears to be missing a key disruptive ingredient, the fight looks like it will get increasingly difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Simplest Way to Build Trust</title>

    <summary>People will cooperate if they find something in common.</summary>

    <category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Collaboration"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Communication"/><category scheme="http://blogs.hbr.org" term="Negotiating"/>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/the-simplest-way-to-build-trust/">
    &lt;p&gt;In the midst of an intense negotiation, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know what&amp;#8217;s motivating the person across the table — is he willing to cooperate with you to meet both your interests or does he only want to serve his? You need to build trust with your counterpart so you can align your interests and increase the likelihood that he will honor his commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful way to establish trust is to employ one of the mind’s most basic mechanisms for determining loyalty: the perception of similarity. If you can make someone feel a link with you, his empathy for and willingness to cooperate with you will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite example of this &lt;a href="http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/christmas-truce-of-1914"&gt;occurred outside Ypres, Belgium in 1914&lt;/a&gt;. The British and the Germans had been fighting a long and bloody battle, but on the eve of December 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the British soldiers began to see lights and hear songs from across the field that separated their trenches from those of their foes. They soon recognized that the lights were candles and the songs were Christmas carols. What happened next was rather amazing. The men from both sides came out of their trenches and began to celebrate Christmas together. Men who had hours before been trying to kill each other were now sharing trinkets and family photos in complete trust that no violence would occur. Why? No one knows for certain, but I suspect that it was because in those moments, the men stopped viewing themselves as British and Germans, and rather saw themselves as fellow Christians. They came to perceive themselves as similar, and that meant they could trust each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might think I’ve constructed a fanciful theory for a fluke occurrence. Fair enough. My colleague &lt;a href="http://www.cmcmeatlab.com/index.html"&gt;Piercarlo Valdesolo&lt;/a&gt; and I wondered the same, so we set out to study it. Although it made good sense that the mind would use similarity as a metric to decide to whom to be loyal, we had no hard proof. To find out if our suspicions were correct, we designed an &lt;a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/52853b8ae4b0a6c35d3f8e9d/t/528d25dae4b059766439b87e/1384981978770/synchrony-and-the-social-tuning-of-compassion.pdf"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; that allowed us to manipulate similarity stripped down to its most basic elements in order to see how it would affect behavior. To do this, we brought participants into the lab one at a time for what they believed was an experiment on music perception. They put on earphones and sat across from another person, who was actually an actor working with us. The task was simple; all it required was tapping the sensor in front of them with their hand to the beats they heard over their earphones. The beats were designed so that some participants could see their hands tapping in synchrony with the actor (who had his own sensors and headphones), while others would see random, unsynchronized tapping. Why the tapping? Moving in time is &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/KEEPING_TOGETHER_IN_TIME.html?id=F5QqSt6umWsC"&gt;an ancient marker the brain uses&lt;/a&gt; to discern who’s similar. It occurs in rituals, in military drills, and in team exercises. If you’re moving in time with someone, it’s a symbol that right here, right now, the two of you are a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tapping, we had designed a situation where the participants would see the actor get stuck while completing an onerous task from which they themselves were excused. But before they left the experiment, they were offered the opportunity to help the actor complete the onerous tasks if they so desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we expected, relatively few people (18%) decided to come to the aid of the other when they hadn’t been synchronized. But if they had tapped in synchrony, the number who helped (50%) jumped dramatically. What’s more, the increase in helping was directly tied to how similar participants felt toward the actor. Surprising as it may seem, those who tapped in synch believed they shared more in common with the actor than those who didn’t, even though they had never said a word to the actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing magical about hand tapping. We’ve found the same effect in several ways, including telling people they shared some esoteric (or even phony) characteristic with another. All that’s required to increase people’s willingness to support each other is any subtle marker of similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it in your next negotiation.  Find and emphasize something – anything – that will cause your partner to see a link between the two of you, which will form a sense of affiliation. And from that sense of affiliation &amp;#8212;  whether or not it’s objectively meaningful – comes a greater likelihood of trustworthy behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to Win the Argument with Milton Friedman</title>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-win-the-argument-with-milton-friedman/">
    &lt;p&gt;In 1970, in his famous essay, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html"&gt;The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman"&gt;Milton Friedman&lt;/a&gt; railed against any corporate attempt to promote “desirable social ends” which he argued were “highly subversive to the capitalist system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, folks who have gotten together in gatherings like last week&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.inclusivecapitalism.org"&gt;Inclusive Capitalism Conference&lt;/a&gt; have argued that Friedman is wrong to make the trade-off between shareholders and the rest of society so wholly in favor of shareholders and that greater balance is required in that trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the fact that they make that argument is precisely why Friedman has won the day for going on half a century, a spectacular success for a social sciences argument. Friedman has won the way a great debater wins — by cleverly framing the terms of the debate, not by brilliantly arguing the logic of the debate once it has been framed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Friedman was so inflammatory in his call for a 100% versus 0% handling of the trade-off, his entire opposition for the entire time since 1970 has focused on making arguments for a number lower than 100% for shareholders. In doing so, they implicitly — and I would argue, fully — accepted Friedman’s premise that there is a fundamental trade-off between the interests of shareholders on the one hand and other societal actors such as customers, employees and communities on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, the Friedmanite defense has been to force the opposition to prove that making a trade-off to any extent whatsoever against shareholders won’t seriously damage capitalism. As a result Friedman is innocent until proven guilty and the opposition guilty until proven innocent. That is why we are exactly where we are nearly a half century later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the opposition been cleverer, it would have attacked the premise from the very beginning by asking: what is the proof that there is a trade-off at all? Had they done so, they would have found out that Friedman had not a shred of proof that a trade-off existed prior to 1970. And they would have found out that there still isn’t a single shred of empirical evidence that 100% focus on shareholder value to the exclusion of other societal factors actually produces measurably higher value for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman, of course, didn’t feel the need to assemble any empirical evidence to support his point. An economist falls apart and turns into a blubbing puddle on the floor if you take away the concept of trade-offs because they all started in the same place: the societal trade-off between guns and butter. Trade-offs are a sacred article of faith for economists. You simply can’t be an economist if you don’t consider trade-offs to be a central feature of your worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an economist but the training apparently didn’t stick entirely for me. I think I read too much Aristotle along the way and to me he just seems smarter than anyone else I have ever read. What he argued about happiness has more direct relevance to shareholder value maximization than anything an economist has ever written. He maintained that happiness does not derive from its pursuit but rather is the inevitable consequence of leading a virtuous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to corporations. If they make it their purpose to maximize shareholder value, shareholders are likely to suffer because that cravenness turns off customers, employees, and the world in general. If they make it their purpose to serve customers brilliantly, be a fabulous place to work, and contribute meaningfully to the communities in which they operate, chances are their shareholders will be very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is my premise and I am sticking to it until someone can provide a shred of evidence that the opposite has any validity whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>You can’t really innovate without bending the rules.</summary>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/the-case-for-corporate-disobedience/">
    &lt;p&gt;If your company puts you in charge of developing a foreign market or a new line of business, your challenges are in many ways similar to those facing a startup. Before you can scale the business, you have to understand what your customers really want and value, and how to deliver it to them — and that process requires a lot of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, you have decent odds of getting it right. Unlike entrepreneurs working out of the proverbial garage, you can draw on your company’s resources to get things done. But as Steve Blank, Henry Chesbrough, and others &lt;a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/03/26/why-internal-ventures-are-different-from-external-startups/"&gt;have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, that advantage is offset by the daunting fact that corporate innovators have to fight a war on two fronts. Like a startup, you have to get the market fit right, but you also have to fight the corporate systems at the same time, dealing with the rules, procedures, and approval processes that every big company has in place to support its strategy. It is a fight that every manager is familiar with, but nowhere is the challenge bigger than when the existing strategy is not aligned with the demands of the situation you are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some extent, you can secure the necessary flexibility by negotiating it up front. Luke Mansfield, the leader of &lt;a href="http://www.iesep.com/en/samsung-s-european-innovation-team-fueling-consumer-driven-growth-89403.html"&gt;Samsung’s successful European innovation team&lt;/a&gt;, did just that; before accepting the job of establishing the new team, &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/how-samsung-gets-innovations-to-market/"&gt;he secured full autonomy along with a three-year grace period&lt;/a&gt; in which his superiors were not allowed to ask for results. But up-front agreements can only carry you so far. Even if you are operating as a completely separate legal entity, getting things done requires you to collaborate with the main business — and in that process, you will quickly run into conflicts of interest and clashes with existing rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the concept of &lt;strong&gt;stealth innovation&lt;/strong&gt; can help you. In the research that my co-author Paddy Miller and I did for our book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Usual-People-Bring-Great-ebook/dp/B00B0SA1KA"&gt;Innovation as Usual&lt;/a&gt;”, we found that successful corporate innovators don’t always stick to the rules. Simply put, sometimes the right thing to do is to stop asking for permission and start bending or even breaking select internal rules, working quietly to help the company succeed in spite of its own control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined in our &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2013/03/the-case-for-stealth-innovation/ar/1"&gt;HBR article on the topic&lt;/a&gt;, rules and other control systems are generally there for a reason, and stealth innovation should be used in moderation and with great care. It is best practiced by people who have been with the company for a while and understand which of the internal rules should NOT be messed with. And it requires a constant vigilance to make sure that you don’t get into legal or ethical grey areas or lose sight of the company’s interests. For one, when you operate under the radar, it is imperative to involve some informal advisors and consult with them regularly, so you don’t become blind to your own actions or start taking dangerous risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the political sciences, the merits of conscientious civil disobedience are &lt;a href="http://alsb.roundtablelive.org/Resources/Documents/NP%202009%20Ostas,%20D.pdf"&gt;well recognized&lt;/a&gt;. But in the business world, strategic rule-breaking is still very much a polarizing idea. We can all agree that companies should strive to empower their employees. But empowering people to the extent of accepting that they should sometimes break internal rules, even if cautiously and with good intentions? &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2013/03/the-case-for-stealth-innovation/ar/1"&gt;When we wrote about the topic last year&lt;/a&gt;, we saw a lot of strong reactions; one commenter even called it &amp;#8220;the work of the devil&amp;#8221;. The concerns over stealth innovation were perhaps most succinctly stated by fellow HBR author Chris Trimble, who &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/03/stealth-innovation-is-not-a-so/"&gt;asked of senior executives&lt;/a&gt;, “How many stealth innovators do you want running around in your company?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is reasonable, and if you are a senior leader, it is tempting to answer &amp;#8220;zero&amp;#8221;. But before you do, consider another question: &lt;strong&gt;How many of your CURRENT success stories have come about because somebody bent the rules?&lt;/strong&gt; If you are like most of the companies we have worked with, several of your existing cash cows were created because somebody bent or even broke a few rules. That aspect of the corporate innovation process is rarely highlighted at awards ceremonies or in newspaper articles, and yet, as any innovator will tell you, it is undeniably there. Yes, breaking rules is risky; but the alternative of relentlessly sticking to them, even when the situation changes, also carries a risk. To deny the potentially positive impact of conscientious rule breaking is to ignore a fundamental truth about how successful companies operate in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it’s not that rules are bad. By and large, corporate strategies and the internal rules they engender are good and useful. But like the laws that shape our societies, they need to be interpreted and challenged when circumstances change. When formally established courts interpret laws, they aim to ensure maximum fairness, but they take a long time. In a company that needs to move fast, the interpretation often has to take place in real time, on the ground. Our job as senior managers is not to prevent all forms of rule breaking. It is to ensure that when the rules occasionally need to be broken, the people we put in charge are equipped with the experience, the incentives, and the informal support systems to make the right calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our family company, founded by my grandfather in 1880, was an importer and distributor of preserved food products in the Greek market. We had dry goods like sugar, coffee, beans, lentils, peas, and chickpeas. We also stocked preserved fish that we supplied to the mountain villages, many of which which had no electricity: Dutch smoked herrings, salted sardines from Portugal, and salted codfish from Norway, Iceland and Canada, all packed in 50 kilo wooden boxes or jute bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a boy, none of our goods were branded; they were all sold in bulk and delivered to grocery stores; competition was all about price. It was not until the mid fifties, when I joined the company after completing my MBA in the US, that all this changed. We started packing products in branded half-kilo and one-kilo plastic bags. We also introduced non-food products to grocery stores, securing the distribution rights for American Home Products and Johnson and Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sales of packaged and branded products rose quickly and we prospered for a while as the first mover. But our industry model was changing as supermarkets started to displace the traditional grocery stores and began sourcing supplies directly. In this new environment there was no longer a viable place in the value chain for the wholesaler, and in order to survive we would have to become commission agents for our suppliers, taking orders from the supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, our early move into branded goods had bought us time to adjust, and we could embark on the process of closing down our wholesale business deliberately. But there was a real risk that we would lose a hefty sum in receivables from our eleven thousand grocery clients all over Greece, many of whom, not expecting more business with us, would sit on their debt to us forever. To reduce the chances of this happening, I made it a point to visit as many of the larger customers as I could to communicate in person that we would no longer be supplying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just about my meeting the customers, of course. There were too many of them for that. I also had to ensure that our sales force would co-operate. Since many of them would be losing their jobs as a result of our change in strategy, their co-operation could not be taken for granted. To secure it I engaged an employment finding agency to help them find new jobs, and paid them their salaries until they did. I also provided them all with warm personal letters of recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t cheap, but the investment paid off, as we were able to recover the vast majority of our receivables. Better yet, the fact that we had made such a graceful departure positioned us well as a commission agent, a role for which it is important that you have a reputation for fair dealing. Trust, not price, is the differentiating factor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Eric Shinseki's resignation won't restore trust, but it does open the door for someone who can.</summary>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/when-to-resign-and-when-to-clean-up-the-mess/">
    &lt;p&gt;The resignation of Eric Shinseki, the now-former U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, doesn&amp;#8217;t solve the problem of an appallingly inefficient VA hospital system with long waiting times for treatment and deaths that happened while veterans waited for care. When should a leader resign, and when should he stay and clean up his mess? Should Shinseki (and President Obama) have resisted calls for his ouster, so that he could stay to address the problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measure a leader, not by the absence of problems, but how he or she confronts those problems and takes action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon is still CEO of JP Morgan Chase, despite financial controversies and big legal settlements of the kind that toppled CEOs of other banks; he has guided the cleanup process, apparently effectively. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi is leading a course correction (no scandal involved) after some analysts said she had taken her eye off the core product and thus should tender her resignation. John Chambers has led Cisco successfully for nearly 20 years through numerous ups and downs including dismantling a messy, controversial organizational structure of his own making (a complicated overlay of councils and boards). Boeing CEO Jim McNerny tackled the life-threatening battery problem on the new 787 Dreamliner aircraft, going from crisis to triumph. Elon Musk of Tesla is one of numerous entrepreneurs who prove their critics wrong by rising to the occasion when fires break out, eventually winning back public trust. And on college campuses right now, after rape and sexual abuse scandals have burst into public knowledge, presidents are still in place changing policies and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generations of Western middle class parents taught their children to clean up their own messes. In adult institutions, that isn&amp;#8217;t always possible or desirable. For every Chambers, McNerny, and Nooyi who handles clean-up, there&amp;#8217;s a Shinseki that must resign. Here&amp;#8217;s what boards and bosses should ask leaders, and leaders should ask themselves, about when to resign, or when to stay for the clean-up campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How mission-critical is the mess?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Is the scandal isolated, or evidence of a widespread systemic problem that hasn&amp;#8217;t been addressed?&lt;/strong&gt; Isolated incidents can be dismissed as unfortunate tragedies. But when a problem pops up in more than one place, and it is central to the mission, and the leader doesn&amp;#8217;t already have a plan in place for fixing it, then it is time for the leader to go. That applies clearly to the VA, where the delays in treatment are core, and Shinseki was in place long enough to have figured this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you know, and when did you know it? Did you take immediate action?&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders should be the first to know, not the last, and when they know, they should take corrective action fast. When then-Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson CEO Jim Burke learned of a Tylenol tampering incident, he immediately ordered the removal of all Tylenol bottles from the market, and sorted out cause and responsibility later &amp;#8212; a famous lesson since taught to generations of business school students. Soon after becoming CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra faced revelations about extensive automotive defects and deaths attributed to them. She immediately made some executive changes, such as appointing a safety officer, and created action plans. She faced a tough situation for a new CEO, especially one who had previously headed the global product development organization, but her swift actions have given her credibility for longer-term changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a distraction? Have you become the story?&lt;/strong&gt; New brooms sweep clean. But leaders who linger after messes surface can get stuck on a failed approach, and they can appear more interested in keeping their jobs than helping the organization achieve its mission. Tony Hayward had to step down as BP CEO after the explosion and oil spill in the U.S. Gulf because of how he handled it; he made headlines by whining about what was happening to him, rather than focusing on the human lives lost and economic costs for the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as cover-ups are usually worse than crimes, it&amp;#8217;s not having a mess on their hands that causes leaders to fail; it&amp;#8217;s how the mess is handled &amp;#8212; the timing, communication, accountability, and compassion. Get those right, and you can continue to handle the clean-up. Get them wrong, and it&amp;#8217;s time to get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinseki, a highly-decorated military veteran, did the honorable thing. He also did the inevitable thing. Cleaning up a mess requires strong will, fast action, new approaches, and a lot of credibility. One resignation doesn&amp;#8217;t restore trust, but it opens the door for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Xiaomi Beats Apple at Product Launches</title>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/how-xiaomi-beats-apple-at-product-launches/">
    &lt;p&gt;The iPhone 6 is due in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build-up to its launch will almost certainly follow the Steve Jobs M.O. Device specifications will remain a closely guarded secret until the launch date (unless an employee forgets his phone at a bar). There will be long lines at stores. We probably won’t be able to actually get the product for a couple of months after the launch. And, of course, users (we) will have no input into what we actually get; Steve Jobs’ dictum that “people don’t know what they want until you show it to them” is still an act of faith for Apple’s management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this the only way to launch new products? Let’s think for a second about the risks inherent in this approach. Imagine that something goes wrong and a hardware glitch makes it necessary to recall and/or repair all products (remember the iPhone4 Antenna problem)? Or what if a certain feature or the device as a whole is a complete miss with consumers (think Apple Maps)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this secrecy comes at a price, both in the supply chain and by creating a difficult workplace. Consider how many people have to keep the secrets: factory workers, supply chain workers, and retail employees. Current employees will work weeks of overtime and self-employed contractors will be hired in the thousands. According to some media outlets, &lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/05/14/apple-restricting-vacation-september-new-launches/"&gt;Apple already announced restrictions for employee vacation in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, probably because of the launch. This elaborate planning process is complex, expensive, and risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is the alternative? In “&lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything/ar/1"&gt;Why The Lean Startup Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; Steve Blank argues for “experimentation over elaborate planning, customer feedback over intuition, and iterative design over traditional &amp;#8216;big design up front&amp;#8217; development”. Blank&amp;#8217;s approach is as relevant to new product launches as to new companies: they are also highly uncertain, with many unknown unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Apple’s competitors is already applying just such an approach to new product launches. Founded in 2010, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi"&gt;Xiaomi &lt;/a&gt;is one of the biggest Chinese smartphone companies. Its revenues last year were already more than $5 billion — not bad for a three-year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Apple, Xiaomi produces its products in small batches, allowing for easy changes based on user feedback. Every Friday there is a major feature update of the operating system and a round of feedback from expert consumers. Because Xiaomi only sells directly to consumers (unlike Apple, which goes through many intermediaries), the company can collect all this feedback and build it into the next generation of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the phone you buy this week can be different from what you’ll buy next week. As one example of the benefits of this approach, Xiaomi got its operating system translated into 24 languages by users and the company didn’t spend a dime. User feedback led to the creation of a very different and much more flexible device. Xiaomi allows users to swap the battery, replace a memory card, change case backs, and remove the SIM card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get us wrong: we are not saying that Xiaomi has a better product than Apple: they are priced differently and they appeal to different segments of the market. We both use iPhones, not Xiaomi products. But many companies that try to take clues from Apple’s playbook on innovation will fail because they don&amp;#8217;t have the marketing clout and brand appeal to push products rather than pull ideas. Further, Apple’s model is driven by the creative genius of individuals like Steve Jobs, who are not easy to find. Without these resources, a company might be much better off following the Xiaomi playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bad weather is better than good weather at sustaining people’s attention and maintaining productivity, according to a study by Jooa Julia Lee of Harvard University, Francesca Gino of Harvard Business School, and Bradley R. Staats of the University of North Carolina. In a study of Japanese bank workers whose windows gave them a view of the weather, a 1-inch increase in daily rainfall was related to a &lt;strong&gt;1.3% decrease&lt;/strong&gt; in worker completion time for data-entry tasks. When the weather is bad, workers are less distracted by thoughts of outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common culprit is out-of-control &lt;em&gt;tooth-to-tail&lt;/em&gt; ratios. In a war zone, some soldiers fight on the front lines. Others maintain supply chains, handle logistics, and otherwise support those front-line troops. Military commanders know they can’t let the tooth-to-tail (or combat-to-support) ratio get too low, or they’ll wind up with a force that costs too much and can’t win the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same in a company. You have front-line employees who create what you sell or who deal directly with customers: software developers, sales reps, call-center staffers, and so on. You also have support staff, including the people in marketing, finance, HR, and other functions. When the tooth-to-tail ratio gets too low, front-line people find that they have to send every customer request or idea for improvement up through the bureaucracy and wait days or weeks for a response. That not only creates long delays for customers; it also makes front-line employees feel disempowered and demoralized. How can they serve the customer when they’re burdened with so much bureaucracy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second likely culprit: too many supervisory layers. Unnecessary supervisors &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/how-a-weekly-meeting-took-up-300000-hours-a-year/"&gt;create work and don’t increase efficiency&lt;/a&gt;, thus lowering an organization’s productivity. And companies often underestimate how expensive all those supervisors really are. Not long ago my colleagues and I studied the cost of adding a manager or executive, and we found a kind of multiplier effect (see the graphic below). When you hire a manager, he or she typically generates enough work to keep somebody else busy as well. Senior executives — SVPs and EVPs — are even more costly. These high-priced folks typically require support from a caravan of assistants and/or chiefs of staff. The support staff generates a lot more work for other people, too. The extra burden comes to 4.2 FTEs per hire, including the executive’s own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/truecostofmanager1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38908" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/truecostofmanager1.png?w=640" alt="True cost of a Manager chart" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found three steps to be helpful in liberating your people from the organizational mire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your tooth-to-tail ratios closely.&lt;/strong&gt; Appropriate ratios naturally vary from one industry to another. But a company can gauge its performance against benchmark levels and make adjustments as necessary. If you can create standard processes for handling queries and ideas from front-line people, that will help them make and execute good decisions faster. You may find that all those support personnel aren’t really necessary — that the tooth can be more effective with a much smaller tail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trim your supervisory layers.&lt;/strong&gt; Compare your managerial spans — the average number of direct reports per supervisor—with industry benchmarks, and adjust your structure accordingly. Take into account, however, that different jobs require different spans of control. The lawyers in your legal department probably do highly specialized work that needs close supervision, thus requiring a narrower span of control. The custodians who clean your facilities, by contrast, can operate under a supervisor with a much broader span of control. Selectively removing supervisors (sometimes referred to as “delayering&amp;#8221;) can reduce workload and costs throughout your organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the caravans.&lt;/strong&gt; It does little good to eliminate unnecessary supervisors if those who remain are as costly and inefficient as ever. In some companies, it’s common for senior VPs to have not just an assistant but a whole coterie of helpers, complete with a chief of staff. These caravans can generate just as much work as the executives themselves — again, a perverse multiplier effect. Limiting (or eliminating) these caravans reduces work and cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have begun to attack these organizational barriers. A large software company we worked with recently eliminated more than 40% of its supervisors, ensuring that the people who actually develop the product aren’t overburdened with managers and other functionaries. When Alan Mulally first became CEO of Ford, he did away with the CEO’s chief of staff position. It was a double-barreled message on Mulally’s part: not only wouldn’t he have a chief of staff; he wouldn’t have a staff at all. His decision precipitated similar moves elsewhere in the organization; no EVP wanted to have a chief of staff when the CEO didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that your top performers want to live up to their full potential. Don’t let organizational obstacles get in their way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/even-small-negotiations-require-preparation-and-creativity/">
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re aware of it or not, you’re negotiating all the time. When you ask your boss for more resources, agree with a vendor on a price, deliver a performance evaluation, convince a business partner to join forces with your company, or even when you decide with your spouse where to go on your next vacation, you’re taking a potentially conflict-filled conversation and working toward a joint solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what a negotiation is — a process in which two parties with potentially competing incentives and goals come together to try to create a solution that satisfies everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people think that negotiation is something that salespeople or procurement professionals do, but it’s something we all do — every day. And it’s not just high-stakes, months-long discussions that warrant a thoughtful approach. It pays to improve your ability to handle all of these situations. This means honing skills such as conflict management (as you’d expect) and creative thinking (which you might not), both of which are critical to reaching mutually beneficial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard many people say that being a good negotiator is about thinking quickly on your feet or being a better orator or debater than your counterpart. Sure, those things are helpful. But the best negotiators I’ve seen in action—the ones who most often get what they want — are those who are the most &lt;strong&gt;prepared&lt;/strong&gt; and the most &lt;strong&gt;creative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, preparation. Preparation is the key to any successful negotiation, but few people spend enough time on it. I’ve had sales leaders tell me that they prepare in accordance with how long it takes to get to their customer’s office. That’s fine if your meeting is in Tokyo and you live in Manhattan. But it’s a recipe for disaster if you’re meeting the customer in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using travel time as a benchmark, you should put at least as much time into getting as ready as you think the negotiation will take — at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true for even seemingly straightforward discussions. If you’ve scheduled a two-hour conversation, spend at least two hours getting ready. And the more complex the issues at hand, the more you need to prepare — at least double or triple the length of time you’ll spend at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times, of course, when you won’t be able to thoroughly prepare: You see your boss on your way into a meeting, for example, and you have to agree on when you’re going to get him that report; a vendor shows up unexpectedly and wants to negotiate a new volume purchase; or a customer calls demanding a price concession. Under those circumstances — and in advance of any negotiation — it’s helpful to start asking yourself what your key interests are and what the other party’s might be, thinking of creative solutions, and identifying persuasive standards. If you think of the discussion as a negotiation rather than a quick check-in, you’re more likely to treat it with the discipline it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, being creative — when preparing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the room. The goal in any difficult conversation is to end up with the best solution out of many possible options. The more options you have at your ready, the more creative you can be.  When brainstorming options in advance or face-to-face with your counterpart, your goal is to develop possible solutions that meet the interests of everyone involved in the negotiation — those deeper needs behind your positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you negotiate, write down as many good, bad, and crazy ideas as you can think of; don’t settle for one or two options. Aim for at least seven or eight, even in a simple negotiation, and many more in a complex one. Allow yourself to come up with solutions that seem unrealistic — often from those impossible options, you’ll see a path toward a more viable one. Each solution you come up with may not address every need you and your counterpart have, but each should address at least a subset for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing this in advance, don’t worry about whether you’ll divulge these options to the other party when you get into the room; just be creative. If you run out of steam, go back and consider your interests and theirs, and see if you can come up with new options that address complementary sets of interests or bridge conflicting ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating every potentially conflict-filled conversation like a negotiation that you need to prepare well advance for and be creative about will help you will help you achieve the results you want whether at home with your spouse or at work with your colleagues, customers, or suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/is-management-due-for-a-renaissance/">
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then, a thinker calls for a &lt;em&gt;renaissance&lt;/em&gt; in some field of work – a rebirth, or return to classic roots after a period of straying from them. Is management – not yet a very old discipline – due for one? When Richard Straub, President of the Peter Drucker Society of Europe, recently &lt;a href="http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/GF/2014-issue2/Issue__2_2014_greattransformation.pdf"&gt;declared so&lt;/a&gt;, it got me thinking by analogy about how one might come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Renaissance was of course the sweeping cultural movement that began in 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Florence and, aided by the newly invented printing press, spread throughout Europe. It lasted into the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, when it was succeeded by the European Enlightenment. The causes of the movement are complex and much debated. During the long decline of the Roman Empire, Italy experienced a steady influx of Greek scholars and texts. Their appearance sparked a new interest in classical writings. At the same time there was growing criticism of the sterile scholasticism of the medieval universities, which had focused on defending dogma with rigorous conceptual analysis and vigorous argument. Instead, there was a new focus on nature and experience and what it meant to be human. Some say that the Black Death, which hit Italy particularly badly in the mid-14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, catalyzed this concern with humanism. Instead of being preoccupied with the afterlife, people turned their attention to life on earth. Thus the recovery of ancient wisdom was accompanied by the pursuit of new perspectives (quite literally, in the case of painting) that would render a more realistic picture of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could even say that the subject of management was touched by that first Renaissance. Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) was one of the first writers to give us an unvarnished perspective of how things really are in powerful enterprises, rather than how we would like them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would a second Renaissance look like in management today? The field as we know it was born as a set of practices for organizing work that took hold in the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. It was radically reformed in the 1950s along what were then conceived to be scientific lines. Although this reform had valuable benefits at the time, someone calling for a second Renaissance might argue that in the decades since then it has degenerated into a new scholasticism, dominated by the sterile dogmas of neoclassical economics. In particular, the economic focus on the individual and instrumental rationality has led to a preoccupation with methods and means, almost to the exclusion of aims and ends. Coupled with mechanical models, this has resulted in an engineering management mindset, in which people are inevitably seen as instruments for another’s purpose, rather than as ends in themselves. The effect of this has been the widespread disengagement of people from work, and the apparent inability of large, successful organizations to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Renaissance would call for a new approach to learning – a humanistic return to experience, practice, and the cultivation of judgment and practical wisdom in managers. Just as was the case with its predecessor, this renaissance would involve a blend of ancient wisdom and new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “scientific model” of management, as Warren Bennis and Jim O’Toole called it (in their 2005 &lt;em&gt;HBR&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2005/05/how-business-schools-lost-their-way/ar/1"&gt;“How The Business Schools Lost Their Way”&lt;/a&gt;), emphasized conceptual knowledge and tools and techniques – what Greek philosophers would have called &lt;em&gt;episteme&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;techne&lt;/em&gt;. It was assumed that organizations could be studied by detached “objective” observers and that management science could be “values-free” – just like the natural sciences. More generally this scientific model has resulted in a misanthropic concept of capitalism that excludes purpose and meaning from its concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Renaissance would call for a recovery of the concept of practical wisdom; of what Aristotle called &lt;em&gt;phronesis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Phronesis&lt;/em&gt; is prudence, the context-dependent, practical common sense needed when we have to make judgments about what is right and wrong – “what is good or bad for man”, as Aristotle put it. From this perspective a “phronetic” discipline like management can never be “values-free”; all management decisions have ethical implications because they deal with people. And people can be passionate participants as well as (occasionally) detached observers; it’s “both…and”, not “either/or”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have learned a lot about the nature of humankind since the 1950s. In his best-selling book &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Righteous Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt likens the human mind to a rider (reason) on an elephant (intuition). Back in the 1950s we thought that the rider was in charge, or ought to be. Evidence is accumulating from several fields that this view is wrong; the elephant is in charge and the rider is a much better rationalizer in hindsight than a reasoner in prospect. It seems that, with our limited conscious mental capacity, our minds have evolved to make fast “good enough” decisions under pressure of time and conditions of uncertainty. Sometimes, especially in evolutionarily unfamiliar contexts, these intuitions play us false, but most of the time they work just fine and we couldn’t live without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is not to replace intuition with reason as the management reformers of the 1950s had hoped, but to develop new understandings of how intuition and reason can work together, especially in the service of creativity and innovation. Once again, it’s “both…and”, not “either/or”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers in the scientific model of management have resisted this view by adopting a “glass half-empty” attitude toward our cognitive powers under the pejorative heading of “heuristics and biases”. As a result, the new findings from the cognitive sciences have not changed our concept of human nature but are being used as springboards for further manipulations. A humanistic second Renaissance would resist this purely instrumental approach by calling for a “glass half-full” attitude toward our mental abilities. It would harness the liberal arts to study the new evidence for its implications for human nature and creativity and what it tells us about how people grow and become engaged with the world. It would recognize that we are social creatures with minds that are embodied, not just “embrained,” and that we can “think” about the world in just as many ways as we can experience it. Our resulting capacity for analogical thought is the key to creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the first Renaissance, the great transformation people are increasingly calling for in management must be fundamentally philosophical. It won’t follow from the adoption of new principles and precepts, rules and tools, although these will surely be invented. Rather it begins with a new synthesis, a new integration of knowledge that already exists but currently lies scattered and incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Any journalist who has spent time in or near the tech industry knows about, and looks forward to Mary Meeker&amp;#8217;s annual Internet Trends Report. It houses a ridiculous volume of data about where the tech industry (and thus, the economy) is pointed. The clumsy slides overflowing with bullet points, photo clips, and &amp;#8217;90s-era charts and graphs never feel amateurish so much as entrepreneurial, the product of the passion and audacity of trying to capture a thorough picture of such a dynamic industry. There is so much to say — who has time to refine the actual presentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends" target="_blank"&gt;2014 Internet Trends Report&lt;/a&gt; continued the tradition and was inevitably&lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/mary-meekers-2014-internet-trends-report-is-a-must-read-20140529-zrrdf.html" target="_blank"&gt; hailed as a must-read&lt;/a&gt;. Meeker uses the &amp;#8220;re-imagining&amp;#8221; theme as she has in the past, this year focusing on re-imagining messaging, apps, content distribution, money, a vertical industry, and even day-to-day activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I clicked through its 164 pages, I found myself thinking that what actually needs re-imagining is the Internet Trends report itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already read about most of the trends Meeker had identified. Some of her points felt not just familiar, but outdated. Yelp, Airbnb and Uber as examples of &amp;#8220;re-imagining user interfaces&amp;#8221; (pages 77-79) felt like old, &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3027107/punk-meet-rock-airbnb-brian-chesky-chip-conley" target="_blank"&gt;old news&lt;/a&gt;, and missing crucial &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/29/london-in-uber-uproar-as-cabbies-plan-massive-gridlock-strike/" target="_blank"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/13/5303344/uber-car-attacked-as-paris-taxi-strike-turns-violent" target="_blank"&gt;context&lt;/a&gt;. The section on the proliferation of screens is an established enough trend that Quartz has&lt;a href="http://glass.qz.com" target="_blank"&gt; launched an entire site&lt;/a&gt; devoted to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to blame Meeker. It&amp;#8217;s an &lt;em&gt;annual&lt;/em&gt; report. For identifying tech trends, that approach is impossibly antiquated. A year ago, Twitter was nearly six months away from going public. And in the six months since its IPO, Twitter&amp;#8217;s been through &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/7/5076484/twitter-ipo-twtr-public-offering-stock" target="_blank"&gt;a honeymoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/" target="_blank"&gt;a backlash&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://qz.com/211402/twitter-doesnt-have-a-growth-problem-it-has-a-perception-problem/" target="_blank"&gt;backlash to the backlash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data used in the report to identify trends is data we get in near-real-time now, streaming through our social feeds and inboxes, and pulled in through search. This data is a commodity now. What we need is more analysis and debate over what it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the trends report doesn&amp;#8217;t ever get to the analysis and debate. That&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s most frustrating. It stops short of examining the deeper, more complex questions surrounding trends it can no longer claim to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Bitcoin is shown to be a growing trend (&amp;#8220;re-imagining money&amp;#8221;), but we&amp;#8217;re way past establishing that, aren&amp;#8217;t we? We&amp;#8217;ve moved on to the headier questions: Is it currency or property? Can it be trusted? There&amp;#8217;s a hopeful section on the rise of tech in education, but it&amp;#8217;s just some stats on the number of users, with no analysis of how apps can and will improve education. Impressive growth in Internet TV is charted; nothing about the crucial battles between disruptors like Aereo and Roku and the established cable and content providers. Netflix is hailed as an analytics champion, but there&amp;#8217;s no mention of the most important trend of all with regard to Netflix, and possibly to the entire Internet—the ongoing tinkering with net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects the nature of the tech industry itself, which is optimistic to a fault. (If you&amp;#8217;ve been watching Silicon Valley on HBO, you&amp;#8217;ve seen this trope hilariously lampooned). It also reflects the fact that Meeker&amp;#8217;s report was intended to quantify all the trends that matter, not to explain or question them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if that purpose changed?  In the spirit of &amp;#8220;re-imagining&amp;#8221; that dominates the report, let&amp;#8217;s re-imagine what the Internet Trends report could be going forward to make it fresh, must-read material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it should be published more frequently—weekly? monthly?—and it should be unbundled and distributed socially. No one report would attempt to encompass the entirety of internet trend. A variety of reports would instead look exclusively at specific trends, still based on data, but with more emphasis on the analysis. Example: A chart on page 38 shows a surprising uptick in Pinterest&amp;#8217;s unique visitors in the past six months. It&amp;#8217;s now second only to Instagram in the image/video sharing category while Tumblr is, well, tumbling. What&amp;#8217;s that about? A monthly report could take on this smaller slice of the greater trend with focused data and analysis in a way the annual report doesn&amp;#8217;t and can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More frequent reporting would allow Internet Trends to become more narrative and less declarative. As it stands with its breadth and lead time, each report feels too isolated. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.kpcb.com/insights/2012-internet-trends" target="_blank"&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, some of the &amp;#8220;re-imaginations&amp;#8221; were note-taking, drawing, photography, and home improvement. One never feels like these are &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; - ongoing patterns we&amp;#8217;re going to follow up on and watch evolve. Even the trends that appear in successive years (in 2012 an Uber-driven &amp;#8220;re-imagination of calling a cab&amp;#8221; appeared) feel unconnected to data presented in ensuing years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to a more frequent publishing cycle would allow the trends to become living things that evolve over time, along with their data and the analysis around them.  Imagine trying to understand a company&amp;#8217;s performance from annual reports alone versus tracking it through more frequent data and quarterly performance calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a new Internet Trends should be more beautiful. I&amp;#8217;ve always forgiven the report&amp;#8217;s charts, but my attitude toward them changed this year. The assault of colors (page 96), number labels (page 21), double-y axes (page 104), and insider acronyms is overwhelming. The visuals don&amp;#8217;t seem worse than in previous years (though there are a couple of egregious errors: the charts on declining computing costs [pages 70-72] are just scaled incorrectly). Data visualization has sped past this level of execution. It&amp;#8217;s not hard to make better charts than this anymore. &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/special-collections/insight/persuading-with-data" target="_blank"&gt;Persuading with data&lt;/a&gt; is serious business, and as the tools and practice of the craft have improved across the web, our tolerance for poor craftsmanship has gone down. Good visual presentation increases our likelihood to use that mobile, social web that Meeker rightly cites as so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m describing is hardly provocative. It&amp;#8217;s a more focused version of what Nate Silver is trying to do with 538 and what Ezra Klein is trying to do with Vox, and what in fact most content sites are beginning to do as the content-based Web enters its next phase. But I&amp;#8217;m not hopeful that Internet Trends will evolve. It&amp;#8217;s possible, even likely, that Meeker has no incentive to turn into the next internet thought celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s too bad. What was once an eagerly awaited moment feels like it matters less and less. Internet Trends has been disrupted, a victim of the very trends it has tried to capture for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/the-best-teams-hold-themselves-accountable/">
    &lt;p&gt;Want to create a high performance team? Want to limit the amount of time you spend settling squabbles between team members? It turns out those two issues are closely related: &lt;a href="http://www.vitalsmarts.com/resource-center/research/"&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; shows that on top performing teams peers immediately and respectfully confront one another when problems arise. Not only does this drive greater innovation, trust, and productivity, but also it frees the boss from being the playground monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first saw the connection between high performance and peer accountability years ago when consulting with a very successful financial services company. It had an unparalleled return on capital, breathtaking sales growth, and the highest customer renewal rate in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first face-to-face meeting with the CEO, whose name was Paul, and his direct reports, I committed a major faux pas. I discovered halfway through the meeting that I was calling the wrong guy, “Paul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an innocent mistake. When it was time to begin, one member of the executive team wasn’t present. He showed up six minutes late and the guy at the head of the table (I learned later that his name was Frank) said, “We all agreed to be here at 10 AM—what happened?” It was a jarring moment. The tardy teammate flushed red, stammered an explanation, and the meeting moved on. I assumed since this guy was at the head of the table and he held the latecomer accountable that this was Paul. I smiled and made a small wave at him. He looked confused but waved back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, Lydia was reporting on sales in her business unit. Apparently, things weren’t going well. The woman next to me asked most of the hard questions about her disappointing performance. Her comments were thoughtful and constructive but firm. She concluded by suggesting that they reconsider how much capital they were deploying in Lydia’s business unit that year. I wondered if maybe she was in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best decision I made that day was to keep my mouth shut. It turned out Paul was the quietest guy in the room. I could have spent the entire time playing “Who’s Paul?” and gotten it wrong every time. (This has since become &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/apr2010/ca20100428_172881.htm"&gt;one of my favorite stories &lt;/a&gt;illustrating the importance of peer accountability.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something strange about that team. And many other teams we subsequently studied. We’ve found that teams break down in performance roughly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the weakest teams, there is no accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mediocre teams, bosses are the source of accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In high performance teams, peers manage the vast majority of performance problems with one another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul didn’t have to monitor latecomers or ask Lydia hard questions because he had created a culture of &lt;em&gt;universal accountability&lt;/em&gt;. The basic principle was that &lt;em&gt;anyone &lt;/em&gt;should be able to hold &lt;em&gt;anyone &lt;/em&gt;accountable if it was in the best interest of the team. Team members were both motivated and able to handle the day-to-day concerns they had with one another, with him, or with anyone outside the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that you can approximate the health of a relationship, a team and an organization by measuring the average lag time between identifying and discussing problems. The shorter the lag time, the faster problems get solved and the more the resolution enhances relationships. The longer the lag, the more room there is for mistrust, dysfunction, and more tangible costs to mount. The role of leader is to shrink this gap. And the best way to do it is by developing a culture of universal accountability. Here are some ways we’ve seen managers like Paul create this kind of norm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Let new team members know up front that you want and expect them to hold &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; and others accountable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell stories. &lt;/strong&gt;Call out positive examples of team members addressing accountability concerns. Especially when they take a big risk by holding &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; accountable. Vicarious learning is a powerful form of influence, and storytelling is the best way to make it happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model it.&lt;/strong&gt; The first time your team hears you gripe about your own peers to others—rather than confronting your concerns directly—you lose moral authority to expect the same from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach it. &lt;/strong&gt;The best leaders are teachers. Codify the skills you think are important for holding “crucial conversations”—and take 5-10 minutes in a staff meeting to teach one. In these teaching episodes, ensure the team practices on a real-life example— perhaps one that happened recently. Trust me, they’ll complain, but this will make a huge difference in retention and transference to real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set an “It takes two to escalate” policy&lt;/strong&gt;. If you struggle with lots of escalations, set a policy that “it takes two to escalate.” In other words, both peers need to agree they can’t resolve it at their level before they bring it to you together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the boss should not be to settle problems or constantly monitor your team, it should be to create a team culture where peers address concerns immediately, directly and respectfully with each other. Yes, this takes time up front. But the return on investment happens fast as you regain lost time and see problems solved both better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/you-cant-delegate-change-management/">
    &lt;p&gt;Many managers, even at the most senior levels, don’t fully appreciate the difference between announcing a major change initiative and actually making it happen. When senior leaders disappear after a big change announcement, and leave lower-level managers to execute it, they are missing in action. And it’s probably more common than most realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement is the easy part; it makes the manager look bold and decisive. Implementation is more difficult, because no matter how good and compelling the data, there will always be active and passive resistance, rationalizations, debates, and distractions – particularly when the changes require new ways of working or painful cuts. To get through this, managers have to get their hands dirty, engage their teams to make choices, and sometimes confront recalcitrant colleagues – none of which can be delegated to subordinates or consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO of a large telecommunications firm announced an enterprise-wide cost-reduction and simplification effort as a way of responding to rapidly changing technologies and new competitive threats. The initiative was launched with great fanfare and positioned as key to the company’s long-term success. A well-known consulting firm was then hired to identify opportunities for streamlining, and with help from an executive sponsor from the CEO’s team, they set up a project management office and war room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, the consulting firm and internal staff collected data on spans and layers, benchmarked industry cost levels, and gathered process improvement ideas. When it came time to present the first set of recommendations to the senior team, however, the CEO was out of town meeting with investors – so the discussion was postponed. A month later, the CEO delayed the meeting again due to a customer problem. The next month, the CEO asked the executive sponsor and the lead consultant to meet with each of his direct reports individually to bring them up to speed on the findings. This led to a series of polite discussions and several requests for more data, but no action. Eventually, the CEO suggested that the executive sponsor figure out a phased approach to implementation, starting with one or two areas. This led to a further series of debates with each senior executive – most of whom had strong reasons why this was not the right time for them to restructure their units and take out key people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably get the picture. After six months, the company had accomplished very little other than to run up a large consulting bill and to waste the time of some of its best and brightest staff. Why does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the CEO was a conflict-averse individual who wanted his team to “work things out” when there was a problem. As he began to realize that not everyone was in agreement, and that the process of change would involve some battles, he withdrew, and perhaps subconsciously, let the project slowly fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could just blame the CEO, or any senior manager in a similar situation, who tries to delegate the implementation of major change. However, when a senior leader is missing in action, the subordinates and consultants who were charged with carrying out the initiative also play a role: They can either reinforce the hesitancy of the senior leader or try to do something about it. The reality is that senior staff people and experienced consultants often continue to collect more data, have more discussions, prepare more reports, and make more presentations – without calling a halt to the process, confronting the boss about his or her role, or suggesting an alternative way of proceeding. It’s like shadow puppet theater with everyone playing his or her role but knowing that nothing will really change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the executive sponsor and the consultants knew the CEO was conflict-averse and receding to the background, but they still played along as if the CEO would eventually step up and intervene. Alternatively, they could have either halted the project or scaled it down to something more manageable as a test case. But by taking the path of least resistance, they just reinforced the dynamics of the executive who was missing in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making major change happen in any company isn’t easy. But when senior executives delegate what should be their responsibilities – and staff and consultants let them get away with it – the chances of success are pretty slim.&lt;/p&gt;

The duo tracked three types of promises — "broken ones, kept ones, and then ones that were fulfilled beyond expectations" — and found that  overdelivering on promises doesn’t get you much of a boost in satisfaction. Epley says this is because a promise is similar to a verbal contract: The expectation is that you will or won’t fulfill it. However, when someone hopes for something that isn’t explicitly promised, exceeding expectations is beneficial. "If you can guarantee an outcome, you’ll make your customers (or bosses) happiest when you promise it," suggests &lt;em&gt;Businessweek's&lt;/em&gt; Claire Suddath. "But if you’re not sure you can do it — or if you think you can do it even better — you might not want to promise anything and surprise them instead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:14px;line-height:18px !important;font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/google-discloses-workforce-diversity-data-good/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Not Good at All &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:18px;line-height:22px !important;font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a style="color:#3366ff;text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/google-discloses-workforce-diversity-data-good/"&gt;Google Finally Discloses Its Diversity Record, and It’s Not Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:12px;line-height:15px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/google-discloses-workforce-diversity-data-good/" style="color:#666666;text-decoration:none;"&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="margin:8px 0 5px; font-size:14px;line-height:22px !important;color:black;"&gt;Google released its global workforce numbers, revealing that 70% of its employees are men, a number that increases to 83% and 79% if you look only at tech jobs and leadership roles. Two percent of Google employees are black. The NewsHour reports that these stats seem slightly more lopsided than other tech companies’, though an &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/05/google-diversity-labor-gender-race-gap-workers-silicon-valley"&gt;analysis by &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows a pretty sad demographic profile at the top 10 Silicon Valley firms, particularly among executives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

There's something to be said for the company’s forthrightness in making its numbers public — Google's Laszlo Bock notes that "all our diversity efforts, including going public with these numbers, are designed to ensure Google recruits and retain many more women and minorities in the future." But some, &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/fixing-googles-gender-gap-shouldnt-hard/"&gt;like Vivek Wadhwa&lt;/a&gt;, "don’t buy its excuses." Wadhwa has a series of recommendations to move the needle. He recommends revamping job descriptions, changing recruitment tactics, including women on hiring teams, and focusing more on competencies than credentials. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:14px;line-height:18px !important;font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-coke-designs-friendly-bottle-can-only-be-opened-another-bottle-157988" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Social Media Gets Physical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:18px;line-height:22px !important;font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a style="color:#3366ff;text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-coke-designs-friendly-bottle-can-only-be-opened-another-bottle-157988"&gt;Coke Designs a Friendly Bottle That Can Only Be Opened by Another Bottle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:12px;line-height:15px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-coke-designs-friendly-bottle-can-only-be-opened-another-bottle-157988" style="color:#666666;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Adweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="margin:8px 0 5px; font-size:14px;line-height:22px !important;color:black;"&gt;The Colombian office of the Leo Burnett ad agency has designed a plastic Coke bottle with a cleverly engineered cap that can be opened only when it’s fitted together with another Coke bottle’s cap and twisted. So you have to find a partner to have one (and buy two at a time). Maybe even cleverer is the market that Leo Burnett targeted to introduce it — a group with a strong need (and a perfect opportunity) to socialize: college freshmen. Likely inspired by the sharable Coke can created last year by Ogilvy France and Ogilvy Asia-Pacific, this latest physical incarnation of social media has the obvious advantage of doubling, rather than cutting in half, potential sales. You can judge for yourself the creativity emanating far from these agencies’ U.S. home bases in the epic 90-second spot. &lt;em&gt;—Andrea Ovans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:14px;line-height:18px !important;font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/214093/tesla-elon-musk-5-billion-gigafactory-gamble/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Go Big or Go Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:18px;line-height:22px !important;font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a style="color:#3366ff;text-decoration:none;" href="http://qz.com/214093/tesla-elon-musk-5-billion-gigafactory-gamble/"&gt;The Cold Logic Behind Elon Musk’s $5 Billion Gigafactory Gamble &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:12px;line-height:15px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/214093/tesla-elon-musk-5-billion-gigafactory-gamble/" style="color:#666666;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="margin:8px 0 5px; font-size:14px;line-height:22px !important;color:black;"&gt;You have to hand it to Tesla's Elon Musk: He does plan ahead. Although many past forecasts for electric-car adoption have missed the mark — China, for instance, will probably fall short of having 500,000 electric cars on the road by 2015 — Musk is betting heavily on the rapid rise of battery-powered vehicles. He's building the world’s largest lithium-ion battery plant, a "gigafactory" capable of making enough battery packs to power half a million electric cars annually. That’s four times the number of electric cars sold globally last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
Of course, powerful forces are working to undermine Musk’s vision: Traditional carmakers are fighting zero-emissions laws, and battery and energy researchers are aiming for breakthroughs that would make the gigafactory’s batteries obsolete. But if Musk is right, his production facilities will bring down the cost of batteries by 30%. And because batteries are the single most expensive component in electric vehicles, that would be a big step toward his dream of a mass-market Tesla car. &lt;em&gt;—Andy O'Connell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:14px;line-height:18px !important;font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/optimal-disclosure-firms-need-balance-hard-soft-information/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;"&gt;The Cost of Transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:18px;line-height:22px !important;font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a style="color:#3366ff;text-decoration:none;" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/optimal-disclosure-firms-need-balance-hard-soft-information/"&gt;Optimal Disclosure: Why Firms Need to Balance Hard and Soft Information &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:12px;line-height:15px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/optimal-disclosure-firms-need-balance-hard-soft-information/" style="color:#666666;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Knowledge@Wharton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="margin:8px 0 5px; font-size:14px;line-height:22px !important;color:black;"&gt;In corporate finance, transparency and disclosure are good things, right? And the more transparency and disclosure the better? Yes — but. When lawmakers and regulators demand disclosure, the kind of information they’re looking for is hard data — revenue, sales, net profits, that kind of thing. Research by Alex Edmans and Mirko Heinle of Wharton and Chong Huang of the University of California Irvine suggests that when executives have to disclose hard data, they lean toward making moves that improve short-term profitability, sometimes to the detriment of the company’s long-term health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
"Since rules can only stipulate the disclosure of hard information, and not soft, they change the relative weight of hard information versus soft information," Edmans says. "Then managers are going to take actions to boost earnings at the expense of long-run intangible value." Foreseeing steadily escalating calls for disclosure, Edmans has a word of warning for those who establish financial rules and regulations: "When policy makers are thinking, "Do we want even more disclosure?' they should think, 'Well, there is a cost to that.'" &lt;em&gt;—Andy O'Connell&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:14px;line-height:18px !important;font-weight:normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/05/27/why-im-ditching-my-amazon-account/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;"&gt;BONUS BITS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:18px;line-height:22px !important;font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a style="color:#3366ff;text-decoration:none;" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/05/27/why-im-ditching-my-amazon-account/"&gt;Three on Amazon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 style="margin:3px 0 0;font-size:12px;line-height:15px; font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/05/27/why-im-ditching-my-amazon-account/" style="color:#666666;text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p style="margin:8px 0 5px; font-size:14px;line-height:22px !important;color:black;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/05/27/why-im-ditching-my-amazon-account/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I’m Ditching my Amazon Account&lt;/strong&gt; (Reuters)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-deal-devil/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishers' Deal with the Devil&lt;/strong&gt; (stratechery)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/how-the-amazon-hachette-fight-could-shape-the-future-of-ideas/371756/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Amazon-Hachette Fight Could Shape the Future of Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (The Atlantic)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="spacer" style="height:26px"&gt;&lt;br style="line-height:26px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/reinvent-your-company-by-reassessing-its-strengths/">
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic consistency is the hallmark of many great companies. Southwest Airlines’ decades-long strategy of “short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare service” produced what was not only one of the &lt;a href="http://www.money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/03/08/363700/index.htm"&gt;best-performing airlines&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. over the last half-century, but also one of the &lt;a href="http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/stock-ratings/?symbol=luv"&gt;best-performing companies&lt;/a&gt; in any industry. For over 50 years, Wal-Mart has pursued essentially the same strategy of “offering the lowest price so its customer can live better.” Wells Fargo has become the &lt;a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/02/03/wells-fargo-tops-list-of-most-valuable-banking-brands/"&gt;most valuable bank in the world&lt;/a&gt; by sticking to its strategy of building a value proposition around selling more products per customer than anyone else. And the essence of Walt Disney’s original strategy remains intact today: to construct a range of businesses — from animated film to fun parks, TV, retail, cruise ships, and more — around a group of engaging, family-friendly characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the corporate landscape is also littered with once-great companies whose strategies became obsolete faster than they were able to reinvent themselves. For example, deregulation killed off icons in the airline business such as Pan Am and TWA. Digital technology overwhelmed Kodak’s once-formidable business in photography. The emergence of e-commerce obliterated the likes of Borders, Circuit City, and Blockbuster. Smartphones destroyed Nokia’s cell phone business. Strategic consistency may be a hallmark of great enterprises, but it hastened the demise of these companies. They needed reinvention, not more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart executives know that sustaining great companies requires both strategic consistency and reinvention. But how do you achieve each without sacrificing the other?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the answer lies in being able to answer — and act on — two important questions: what capabilities set your company apart from everyone else? And, are there changes happening in your world that will make those capabilities obsolete or insufficient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of strategic consistency is being clear about the capabilities that make your company special. Frito-Lay’s direct-to-store delivery capability, Inditex’s fast-fashion supply chain, and Toyota’s production system took years to hone into true sources of enterprise differentiation. If a company’s leaders understand the capabilities that define its unique identity, they’ll make smarter decisions about what businesses to buy and sell, what markets to enter and exit, what to prioritize in new product development, how to manage costs, where to invest, and all the other choices that are inherent in sustaining a great company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, leaders must always ask themselves whether their differentiating capabilities are still relevant. Today, all the major credit card companies are seeking to move from traditional payments to digital commerce. In payments, core capabilities are tied to driving card usage because the economic model is based on card transaction fees; but as they move into digital commerce, most credit card firms are finding they lack a new set of required capabilities — the ability to generate, analyze, and use customer data in order to drive sales and loyalty for their primary customer, the merchants who accept their cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in big-box retailing, most players have run out of room in their home markets for laying down more super stores, so they are seeking growth by using a small-store format to penetrate pockets of geography that their bigger stores cannot reach. But the capabilities — from merchandising to managing store staff and operating the supply chain — are very different for a small-store format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or consider U.S. health care providers: the push for more accountable care will require new business models where risk sharing with private and government insurers becomes more the norm. And, yes indeed, such models will demand a set of capabilities now alien to most care providers. Leaders of any company operating credit cards, big box retailing, or health care should be be saying to themselves, “Yes, changes happening in our world &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; making our capabilities insufficient, if not obsolete. Strategic consistency is not enough right now; we need strategic reinvention to shore up and bolster the foundation of capabilities that will underpin great performance from the business we will have, not just the business we have today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of leaders who have successfully managed the tension between strategic consistency and reinvention to survive major changes and create a new life for their companies. Andy Grove pivoted Intel from a memory chip to a smart chip company; Lou Gerstner turned IBM from a hardware OEM to an IT services provider; and Phil Knight transformed Nike from a sports shoe company to a sports licensing company. In each case, the reinvention was about adding new capabilities to those that made the company great in the first place. Thus, neither its reinvention meant the loss of strategic consistency nor did strategic consistency come at the cost of falling behind the changes happening all around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing the tension between strategic consistency and reinvention does not have to mean taking less of one in order to have more of the other. If you correctly identify the capabilities that make your company great and build your strategies around them, and if you act smartly on the enhancements or additions to those capabilities that your changing world requires, you will achieve the benefits of strategic consistency while also preparing your company for the seismic shifts that are inevitable in every industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/millennials-are-cynical-do-gooders/">
    &lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to caricature Millennial workers as bright-eyed idealists, given their loudly stated preference for having a social impact through their careers. Either that or as &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/05/millennials-the-greatest-generation-or-the-most-narcissistic/256638/"&gt;narcissists only out for themselves&lt;/a&gt;. But neither is quite true, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/05/millenials-upend-wall-street-corporate-america-winograd-hais"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; from The Brookings Institution. It’s easy to cherry-pick from the data to verify a stereotype about Millennials one way or the other, but the holistic picture painted by the paper is more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation born in the 80’s and 90’s does have an earnest belief that companies should care about the environment and other social issues, but they’re also the least trusting generation on record. And those two impulses aren’t contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millennials score lower than any other generation in terms of believing that people can be trusted, and that that cynicism rose in the years following the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/millennialsareless.gif"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39121" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/millennialsareless.gif?w=640" alt="Millennials Are Less Trusting Chart" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millennials remain scarred by the financial crisis and ongoing tepid recovery (for instance, they keep more than half their savings in cash &amp;#8212; much more than older generations do). The Brookings paper, a roundup of existing research on millennials, quotes a UBS report calling them “the most [financially] conservative generation since the Great Depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between Millennials&amp;#8217; hope and their cynicism often gets expressed as pragmatism. They aren’t particularly ideological, but they are attuned to global instability and injustice, economic and otherwise. As the authors put it, “The desire of Millennials for pragmatic action that brings results will overtake today’s emphasis on ideology and polarization as Boomers finally fade from the scene.” Millennials ditched their parents’ ideology but kept their insistence on a better world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means prioritizing social goals at work, of course &amp;#8212; the paper cites a 2012 survey noting that two thirds of millennial workers said they want their employer to contribute to social or ethical causes. But they want to change the system from within: the organizations Millennials most want to work for include tech giants like Google, Apple, and Facebook, or the government &amp;#8212; hard to get more establishment than that. When they are attracted to social impact organizations, they’re those that are designed to be short-term commitments, like Teach for America or the Peace Corps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/millenialsideal.gif"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39122" src="http://hbrblogs.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/millenialsideal.gif?w=640" alt="Millennials's Ideal Employers Chart" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a USC study of Millennials working at PwC noted their demand that companies “make good use of worker’s time, be transparent with them, and provide a supportive work community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this list of demands for corporations starts to expand beyond the environment and social ills to include transparency, engagement, and work-life balance, older generations might be again tempted to write Millennials off as naive. But perhaps younger workers are just expanding the role of the corporation beyond the interests of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brookings paper cites research from Pew, noting that “about two-thirds of the Millennials surveyed in 2012 also agreed that ‘businesses make too much profit,’ which was the highest level of agreement among all generations.” That’s the thread that ties Millennials’ disparate demands together, even if most of them wouldn’t express them with reference to fiduciary duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s younger workers aren’t seeking a revolution. They’re too practical for that. Instead, they’re taking jobs in corporate America and, in the process, insisting that average companies clean up their act. For decades, Wall Street has driven corporations to prioritize shareholder value above employees, the environment, social issues, and sometimes even customers. Now a wary, pragmatic generation is asking for those priorities to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A few years back, I took over a large research business that was dangerously close to free-falling. Sales had shrunk for 13 consecutive quarters. Many of the best people had left for greener pastures; the worst people had been laid off.  One of the board members joked that the only employees left were politically-adept mediocre players. That wasn’t completely true, but it wasn’t totally false, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team I encountered when I arrived was made of a single, distinctive type. They were 100% male, and 100% former jocks&amp;#8211;mostly basketball players. Sports permeated the culture. Monday morning staff meetings were spent recounting the weekend’s pro sports games, or their own amateur athletic endeavors. The sports focus created enormous insularity—it was difficult for anyone who didn’t follow the Bruins or the Pats to gain traction in a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, their business performance was abysmal. These guys would make a forecast on Monday and miss it Friday of that same week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up replacing that team with a mixture of men and woman with many different backgrounds, effectively breaking up the company’s sports cabal. Soon the jock network was gone.  It was not intentional—I never consciously thought, “I need to get rid of the jocks.” I just put in place the folks I though were best, jock or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience has stayed with me, however. Many companies have strong jock cultures, particularly in their sales departments. Many managers prefer to hire former athletes, figuring that someone who’s put in years of (sometimes painful) hard work to become a high-performer in a competitive sport will show the persistence needed to succeed in non-athletic pursuits, too. In business-to-business selling, entertaining clients at pro sporting events (or on the golf course) is commonplace, so it’s natural that sports fans gravitate to these jobs. (Some of those jobs all but require people to become conversant in sports, even if they’re not really interested.) And in any company, it’s natural for cliques to develop, and for people with similar interests to band together—whether the groups consist of people who do yoga at lunchtime, gossip about reality TV shows, or knit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I’ve come to believe that having an intense jock culture creates an unusual set of problems. First, the teams are not just dominated by men—they’re almost exclusively men. And anyone who has successfully built teams over the years knows firsthand how crucial woman are to better team performance.  Second, the sports metaphors run out of explanatory steam very fast.  How many times can you say “We need to keep pushing the ball up-court&amp;#8221;?  Third, diverse of points of view are lacking. Groupthink sets in, and teams tend to keep pursuing the same strategy, whether it’s working or not. Fourth, this all adds up to an exclusionary vibe.  Different types of people are not welcome. If you’re really smart, but a bit different, it  doesn’t matter. You’re not accepted, nor do want to join in the first place. This puts the organization on a death path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience turning around the formerly jock-oriented company, the more I traveled around this business, the more I learned how much its formerly cliquish insularity had been hurting its overall performance. I met many men and women (especially women) who’d concluded they’d never get promoted, recognized for awards, or included in the company’s elite trip to Hawaii (for high sellers) because they didn’t fit in with the jock group. They did what they had to do to keep their jobs—but no more, because they felt demoralized and excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the jocks’ control of the culture abated, these workers began to shine. They&amp;#8217;d been working at about 70% of their capacity, they told us. Once they were convinced the culture was changing and realized they could be promoted and rewarded, they worked harder. Productivity soared. When a few thousand people increase their productivity by 30%, it has a meaningful impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new leadership team hadn’t anticipated this effect. While we hadn’t liked the culture we encountered when we arrived, we’d seen so many jock-centered cultures during our time in business that we’d become used to them. We hadn’t focused on the culture as the problem—we’d focused on the poor performance. It wasn’t until after we broke that culture that we saw how pernicious it had been—and saw a measurable payoff from working to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I love sports. I played in high school and college. (I was mediocre.) I still enjoy going to games of all kinds. I follow the standings, especially in baseball. In fact, a few years ago I took many dozens engineers from foreign countries to Yankee Stadium.  They had been fascinated by the strategic aspects of baseball and wanted to see a bit of American culture, and our outing was a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being a sports fan is just one aspect of my personality and life. It doesn’t dominate what I think about—not even close. At our Monday morning meetings, sports does come up occasionally. But my team is just as likely to talk about taking our kids to the zoo, a book we finished reading, or a good vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
